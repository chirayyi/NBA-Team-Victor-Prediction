# NBA-Team-Victor-Prediction

To run our model in predicting what a team's win percent is going to be, in model_construction.ipynb, under the "Initial Model Test" section, run the predict_win_pct function. 

It takes 4 parameters:
- The data
- The current season you want to predict (your testing season)
- The number of previous seasons you want to use to train on (must be greater than 0)
A boolean indicating True if you want to classify win_pct and see whether a team will have a win_pct of above or below 50% for the given season or False if you want to predict the raw win_pct. 

There are additional examples after the first example in that section. 

If you would like to see our EDA and how we collected this data then see the other notebook.
